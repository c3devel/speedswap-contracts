# Speedswap

This repository hosts a fork of the Uniswap V2 protocol, modified to include a key functional change: the creation of liquidity pools with variable fee structures. In this modified version, a pool's uniqueness is determined by a combination of two token addresses and a uint8 value that specifies the fee level.

This adjustment introduces the flexibility found in Uniswap V3 for setting fees suitable for pools with volatile tokens. However, it retains the simpler and more user-friendly framework of Uniswap V2, particularly by avoiding the complexity of managing liquidity positions as NFTs.

We welcome feedback, discussions, and contributions to refine and improve this project.
